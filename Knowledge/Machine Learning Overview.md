# What is Machine Learning
Machine learning is a branch ofÂ artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science which focuses on the use of data and algorithms to imitate the way that humans learn, gradually improving its accuracy. 

# Learning Process:
- ## Collect some data
	Data is important for machine learning especially in training process. 
	Data collection including several steps:
	- Data Ingestion
	- Data Modeling
	- Data Orchestration
	- Data Cleaning
- ## Choose a hypothesis class or model
- ## Choose a loss function
- ## Choose an optimization procedure
- ## Justifying the accuracy of the estimate

# Types of Machine Learning and top algorithms 
- ## Supervised Learning
	Supervised learning models are models that map inputs to outputs, and attempt to extrapolate patterns learned in past data on unseen data. Supervised learning models include [[Regression Models]], where we try to predict a continuous variable like housing prices, or [[Classification Models]], where we try to predict a binary or multi-class variable, like whether an email is spam or not.
