Regression models are a type of statistical analysis used in various fields to understand and quantify the relationship between one or more independent variables (also called predicators or features) and a dependent variable (also called the target or outcome). The primary of regression analysis is to predict or explain the value of the dependent variable based on the values of the independent variables.

In simpler terms, regression models help us make predictions or understand how changes in one or more variables can influence the outcome we're interested in. These models assume that there's a linear or nonlinear relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable.

There are several types of regression models:
1. [[Linear Regression]]
2. [[Multiple Regression]]
3. [[Polynomial Regression]]
4. [[Ridge & Lasso Regression]] 
5. [[Logistic Regression]]
