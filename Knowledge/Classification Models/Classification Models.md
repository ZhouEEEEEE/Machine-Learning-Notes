Classification models are a type of machine learning or statistical analysis used to categorize data points into different classes or categories. These models are trained to learn patterns and relationships in the data that can help distinguish between different classes based on the values of input features. The primary goal of classification is to assign new, unseen data points to one of the predefined classes.

In essence, classification models enable automated decision-making by learning from labeled training data and then applying that learning to classify new, unlabeled data. They are widely used in a variety of applications such as image recognition, spam detection, medical diagnosis, sentiment analysis, and more.

There are several types of classification models:
1. [[Logistic Regression]]
2. [[Decision Trees]]
3. [[Random Forest]]
4. [[Support Vector Machines(SVM)]]
5. [[Naive Bayes]]
6. [[K-Nearest Neighbors(KNN)]]
7. [[Gradient Boosting]]
